AI-Powered Deadlock Detection System
Smarter Deadlock Prediction with Machine Learning
🔍 Project Overview
An intelligent system that detects deadlocks in real-time using machine learning while maintaining simplicity. Unlike traditional methods, this solution combines algorithmic analysis with predictive modeling for higher accuracy, all through a clean Flask-based web interface.

🎯 Core Objectives
✔ Accurate Detection – Hybrid approach (Banker’s Algorithm + ML) for reliability.
✔ User-Friendly UI – Simple matrix input with instant results.
✔ Educational Value – Learn about deadlocks interactively.

🚀 Key Features
🔍 AI-Enhanced Detection
Logistic Regression & SVM for deadlock probability estimation.

Pre-trained model on synthetic resource allocation data.

Explainable results – Shows why a deadlock might occur.

📊 Simple Yet Effective Interface
Input Allocation, Request, and Available matrices easily.

Real-time "Deadlock" / "No Deadlock" result.

Minimalist design – No complex setup required.

📚 Learning Resources
Beginner-friendly guides on deadlocks.

Examples & edge cases explained.

🛠️ Tech Stack (Original & Efficient)
Backend: Python (Flask)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Jinja2

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

No over-engineering – Lightweight and easy to deploy.
